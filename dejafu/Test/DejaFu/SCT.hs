  -- * Bounded Partial-order Reduction

  -- | We can characterise the state of a concurrent computation by
  -- considering the ordering of dependent events. This is a partial
  -- order: independent events can be performed in any order without
  -- affecting the result, and so are /not/ ordered.
  --
  -- Partial-order reduction is a technique for computing these
  -- partial orders, and only testing one total order for each partial
  -- order. This cuts down the amount of work to be done
  -- significantly. /Bounded/ partial-order reduction is a further
  -- optimisation, which only considers schedules within some bound.
  --
  -- This module provides a combination pre-emption, fair, and length
  -- bounding runner:
  --
  -- * Pre-emption + fair bounding is useful for programs which use
  --   loop/yield control flows but are otherwise terminating.
  --
  -- * Pre-emption, fair + length bounding is useful for
  --   non-terminating programs, and used by the testing functionality
  --   in @Test.DejaFu@.
  --
  -- See /Bounded partial-order reduction/, K. Coons, M. Musuvathi,
  -- K. McKinley for more details.

  -- ** Pre-emption Bounding

  -- | BPOR using pre-emption bounding. This adds conservative
  -- backtracking points at the prior context switch whenever a
  -- non-conervative backtracking point is added, as alternative
  -- decisions can influence the reachability of different states.

  -- ** Fair Bounding

  -- | BPOR using fair bounding. This bounds the maximum difference

  -- performed.

  -- * Random Scheduling

  -- | By greatly sacrificing completeness, testing of a large
  -- concurrent system can be greatly sped-up. Counter-intuitively,
  -- random scheduling has better bug-finding behaviour than just
  -- executing a program \"for real\" many times. This is perhaps
  -- because a random scheduler is more chaotic than the real
  -- scheduler.

dependent :: MemType -> DepState -> ThreadId -> ThreadAction -> ThreadId -> ThreadAction -> Bool
-- This is basically the same as 'dependent'', but can make use of the
-- additional information in a 'ThreadAction' to make different
-- decisions in a few cases:
--
--  - @SetNumCapabilities@ and @GetNumCapabilities@ are NOT dependent
--    IF the value read is the same as the value written. 'dependent''
--    can not see the value read (as it hasn't happened yet!), and so
--    is more pessimistic here.
--
--  - When masked interruptible, a thread can only be interrupted when
--    actually blocked. 'dependent'' has to assume that all
--    potentially-blocking operations can block, and so is more
--    pessimistic in this case.
--
--  - The @isBlock@ / @isBarrier@ case in 'dependent'' is NOT a sound
--    optimisation when dealing with a 'ThreadAction' that has been
--    converted to a 'Lookahead'. I'm not entirely sure why, which
--    makes me question whether the \"optimisation\" is sound as it
--    is.
--
--  - Dependency of STM transactions can be /greatly/ improved here,
--    as the 'Lookahead' does not know which @TVar@s will be touched,
--    and so has to assume all transactions are dependent.
